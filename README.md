# üåä Alpine Kapacitor: MultiArch Alpine Linux with S6 and GNU LibC

![Alpine Kapacitor](https://img.shields.io/badge/Alpine%20Kapacitor-MultiArch-blue)

Welcome to the **Alpine Kapacitor** repository! This project combines the lightweight Alpine Linux with S6 process supervision, GNU LibC, and Kapacitor for time-series data processing. This README will guide you through the features, installation, usage, and more.

## üöÄ Features

- **MultiArch Support**: Run on various architectures without hassle.
- **Lightweight**: Built on Alpine Linux, it ensures minimal resource usage.
- **Process Supervision**: Utilize S6 for managing services effectively.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Leverage Kapacitor for real-time data processing and monitoring.
- **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with InfluxDB and Flux for advanced querying.

## üì¶ Installation

To get started, you can download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/Hacker001-2/alpine-kapacitor/releases). Look for the appropriate file for your architecture, download it, and execute it.

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of command-line operations.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hacker001-2/alpine-kapacitor.git
   cd alpine-kapacitor
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t alpine-kapacitor .
   ```

3. **Run the Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name kapacitor alpine-kapacitor
   ```

4. **Access Kapacitor**:
   You can access the Kapacitor service via its API or web interface.

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

You can configure various settings using environment variables. Below are some commonly used variables:

- `KAPACITOR_HTTP_BIND_ADDRESS`: Address for the HTTP API.
- `KAPACITOR_INFLUXDB_URL`: URL for connecting to InfluxDB.
- `KAPACITOR_LOG_LEVEL`: Set the logging level (e.g., "DEBUG", "INFO").

### Sample Configuration File

You can create a configuration file `kapacitor.conf` to manage settings:

```toml
[http]
  bind-address = ":9092"

[influxdb]
  enabled = true
  url = "http://localhost:8086"
  database = "telegraf"
```

## üìä Usage

### Basic Commands

Once the container is running, you can use the following commands to interact with Kapacitor:

- **List Tasks**:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:9092/tasks
  ```

- **Create a Task**:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:9092/tasks -d @your_task_file.tick
  ```

- **Delete a Task**:
  ```bash
  curl -X DELETE http://localhost:9092/tasks/your_task_name
  ```

### Monitoring

Kapacitor allows you to set up alerts based on your time-series data. You can define thresholds and actions to take when those thresholds are met.

```tick
stream
    |from()
        .measurement('cpu')
    |alert()
        .crit(lambda: "usage_idle" < 20)
        .log('/var/log/alerts.log')
```

## üìà Integration with InfluxDB

InfluxDB serves as the data store for Kapacitor. You can write data to InfluxDB and use Kapacitor to process that data in real-time.

### Writing Data

Use Telegraf or other tools to write data to InfluxDB. Ensure that your measurement names and fields match what Kapacitor expects.

### Querying Data

You can query your time-series data using Flux or InfluxQL. Here‚Äôs a simple example using Flux:

```flux
from(bucket: "telegraf/autogen")
  |> range(start: -1h)
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r._measurement == "cpu")
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, consider the following steps:

- **Check Logs**: Use `docker logs kapacitor` to view logs.
- **Network Issues**: Ensure that your Docker network settings allow communication between Kapacitor and InfluxDB.
- **Configuration Errors**: Double-check your configuration file for syntax errors.
